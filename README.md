## Introduction

The TransparentTax project aims to provide a platform that enables citizens to monitor and track government financial transactions. By leveraging web3 technology and incorporating TRUFFLE and REACTJS, the application ensures a secure and decentralized environment.

## Installation

To try out our project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download all the files.

2. Navigate to the client folder and install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   Note: Ensure that you have npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system before running the above command.

3. After installing the npm packages, start the application by running the following command:

   ```
   sudo npm start
   ```

   Note: Depending on your system's configuration, you might need to use `sudo` to run the application.

4. Due to potential compatibility issues with newer versions, please ensure you have the correct version of `react-router-dom` installed by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install react-router-dom@5
   ```

   This step is crucial to avoid any potential errors during the execution of the application.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete and the application is running, you can access the TransparentTax platform through your web browser. The interface should be user-friendly and intuitive.

As a user, you can explore government financial transactions, search for specific entries, and view detailed information about each transaction. The transparency of these financial records aims to foster public trust and promote accountability.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any errors during the installation or execution of the application, here are some tips:

1. Ensure that you have the correct version of `react-router-dom` installed. Use the following command to install version 5:

   ```
   npm install react-router-dom@5
   ```

2. If the application shows an error, try running it multiple times. In some cases, certain components may require a few attempts to initialize correctly.

3. Check the terminal or console output for any error messages, and try to identify the cause of the issue. If you encounter any difficulties, consider seeking help from the project's community or support channels.
